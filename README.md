# Tracking and Analysis of self-propelled droplets
In this project, a synthetic realization of an active matter system consisting of 50 self-propelled droplets is analyzed through the means of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.
Droplet trajectories are extracted from video recordings with a tracking pipeline that is developed using computer vision algorithms, allowing us to characterize the dynamical collective behaviour of the system.
